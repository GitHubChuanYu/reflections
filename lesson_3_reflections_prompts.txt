When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer: When I want to commit my local repository to GitHub, I want to create a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer: Because it is more flexible for me to control when to pull which specific changes from remote repository.
