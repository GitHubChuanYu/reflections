When would you want to create a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

Answer: When I want to commit my local repository to GitHub, I want to create a remote repository.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

Answer: Because it is more flexible for me to control when to pull which specific changes from remote repository.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

Answer: Forks are copy of repository in GitHub, clones are copying of repository from GitHub to local, branches are copying of repository
in local. When I need to make a separate development from my main repository, I create a branch. When I need to copy from a repository from GitHub,
I will use clone. When I need to copy repository from someone else in GitHub to my GitHub repo, I use fork.
